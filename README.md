# Journal to PDF
Is a FoundryVTT module that adds a button to the journal which allows you to export that journal as a PDF.
- System agnostic.
- PDF is rendered by, and downloaded from, the browser.
- Potentially supports theming, although no themes have been created yet. These would be added to `/styles/init.css #pdf`. If anyone contributes a theme, I will add theming as a setting.
